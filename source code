Notes : 
If you are doing it for the first time then create a new gmail account.
Step after creating account
Basic opening normally account not change in it
Then there is a option of 2 step verification - on the 2 step verification via mobile number
After that we need a APP PASSWORD which is a password which is generated by google for this type of use 
To get the “APP PASSWORD” was a challenge task 
Because google update and changes the location of most of the options 
I am writing this code on 24/07/2023
The technique I found on the we are searching is found in 2 step verification 
Go to APP PASSWORD there will be 2 drop down 
First select mail 
Second others - write python (anything you want to write)
You will get the APP PASSWORD it looks like - #### #### #### #### (here # is just an array there will be a set of alphabets)
Copy that and paste in the code above
